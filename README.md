#Mobile App for Alviso Adobe Park
##Proposal
As a frequent attendee of the Alviso Adobe park, I would like to volunteer some development effort to contribute a mobile app for iPhones, which allows community members to instantly view today's events and weather at the park, the calendar, and information on the park and its history.  In the future, it could potentially also display information on the collection pieces, contain audio guides, etc.

The concept is to make information important to patrons' decision to visit the park (weather, calendar) immediately available on their mobile devices, and then enhance their experience once in the park
